# Homework

Homework was about "Choosing an existing website" So I went with the 'Amazon Store' website. this HW was in (SE-2111) Software Engineering,

I answered about these questions :

- What is the category of the business, and is this obvious on the website?  Is the design accomplishing the purpose of the website?  Who is the target audience and how does the design take this into consideration?
- How long does it take for pages to load, and will the visitors get bored waiting? There are free tools online to test page load speeds. Can information be found easily? Is there a search button available for visitors? Are all the links working? There are tools available online to check a website's links. Does the website work in different browsers? Check all the widely used browsers. Does the website work on mobile devices?
- Are the fonts that have been chosen easy to read? Is there considerable contrast between the font color in the background color? Is the text an appropriate size? Is the content concise yet still useful?

I hope you enjoy reading the research and be beneficial to you.

Finally, I would like to thank Dr.Mohammed Assiri very much for giving me the opportunity to share my experiences on the site and for all it has provided us. 
Wishing him continued success
